# Our Family Restaurant

Our Family Restaurant website is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on a wide range of devices. Visitors can explore our charming hut nestled in the heart of the Alps, with high-quality images showcasing the restaurant, our delicious meals, and the stunning natural surroundings. The website features an easy-to-navigate menu overview and offers the convenience of making online reservations. Additionally, visitors can find our location and contact details to plan their visit with ease.

Add a Blurb about the site here, what does it do, why did you build it?

Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

If you want to add optional [shields.io](https://shields.io) badges to your README, I like to add them to this section.

## User Experience (UX)

The user experience on the finished restaurant website should be intuitive, engaging, and efficient. Here’s a breakdown of what the experience should look like for both visitors (guests) and registered users, as well as the admin:

* General User Experience
  * Intuitive Navigation: The website should be easy to navigate, with a clear and simple menu bar or navigation system that allows users to quickly find what they need (e.g., menu, reservations, location).
  * Responsive Design: The site should be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
  * Visual Appeal: The design should be visually appealing, reflecting the restaurant's brand and atmosphere. High-quality images of the restaurant and its dishes should be prominently featured.
  * Performance: The website should load quickly, with minimal latency, to keep users engaged.
  * Accessibility: The website should be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by following best practices like alt text for images, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.

### User Stories

See our [GitHub User Stories](https://github.com/users/DesislavaNaydenova/projects/4/views/4)

## Design

👩🏻‍💻 View an example of a completed design section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022#Design)

### Colour Scheme

Add all information about your colour scheme for your site here. You can explain why you choose the colours you did?

I like to include a palette of the colour scheme here, my favourite site for creating a colour palette is [coolors](https://coolors.co/), but there are lots of other sites that also do the same thing, like [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23F5F5F5&sub=1), [Muzli Colors](https://colors.muz.li/), [Adobe Colour Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) to name a few.

### Typography

If you've imported fonts to use in your project, add some information about them here. You can include information like:

Why did you choose the font you have?
Is this an accessibly friendly font?
What weights have you included?

I also like to include an image of the fonts chosen as a reference.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a popular choice for importing fonts to use in your project, as it doesn't require you to download the fonts to use them.

### Imagery

Use this section to explain what sort of imagery you plan to use through your site.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using balsamiq.

![Tablet View](assets/images/tablet_view.jpg)

![Desktop View](assets/images/desktop_view.jpg)

## Features

👩🏻‍💻 View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Database Schema

### Entity-Relationship Diagram
Below is the Entity-Relationship Diagram representing the database structure of the project.
![ERD](assets/images/ERD.jpg)

- **Admin:** The Admin table stores information about the administrative users who can manage the site.
- **Users:** The Users table stores data for registered users.
- **Reservations:** The Reservations table stores data for reservations made from registered and not registered(guests) users.
- **Tables:** The Tables table ceeps track of all the tables available in the restaurant , with capacity and current status.
- **OpeningHours:** The OpeningHours table defines the opening an closing times for each day of the week.




## Technologies Used

👩🏻‍💻 View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

Make a note here of all the languages used in creating your project. For the first project this will most likely just be HTML & CSS.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

- [DBDiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/) for the ERD.

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) used to create wireframes.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) saves and stores the files for the website.

- [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) IDE used to create the site.

- [Am I Responsive?](https://amiresponsive.co.uk/) shows the website image on a range of devices.

- [StartBootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/) for Bootstrap themes.

- [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/) fot developing the project.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment to Heroku

#### Create the Heroku app
1. Navigate to your Heroku dashboard and create a new app with a unique name.

2. Click on the Settings tab and reveal the config vars. Add a key of DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and a value of 1 and click Add.

#### Update your code for deployment
3. Install a production-ready webserver for Heroku.

pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1 
Add gunicorn==20.1.0 to the requirements.txt file with:

pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
Note: gunicorn is a production equivalent of the manage.py runserver used in development but with speed and security optimisation.

4. Create a file named Procfile at the root directory of the project (same directory as requirements.txt).

Note: The Procfile has no file extension.

5. In the Procfile, declare this is a web process followed by the command to execute your Django project.

web: gunicorn my_project.wsgi
This assumes your project is named my_project.

Note the space after the colon.

Note: gunicorn my_project.wsgi is the command heroku will use to start the server. It works similarly to python3 manage.py runserver.

6. Open the my_project/settings.py file and replace DEBUG=True with DEBUG=False.

Note the comment regarding security in production.

7. Also, in settings.py we need to append the Heroku hostname to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list, in addition to the local host we added in the last lesson.

,'.herokuapp.com'
Note: Remember the comma and the dot before herokuapp.

8. You can now git add the files you have modified, git commit them and push them to GitHub.

#### Deploy on Heroku
9. Now, let's return to the Heroku dashboard, and in your app, click on the Deploy tab.

10. In the Deployment method section enable GitHub integration by clicking on Connect to GitHub.

If you have not deployed a project from GitHub before then, you will be asked to authenticate with GitHub.

11. Start typing your project repo name into the search box and click Search. A list of repositories from your GitHub account should appear. Click on the GitHub repo you want to deploy from.

12. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Deploy Branch to start a manual deployment of the main branch.

You can view the build output in the application's Activity tab in the dashboard.

13. Click on Open app to view your deployed project.

Note: You will have to append /hello to the browser URL just as you did locally to see your view output.

14. Open the Resources tab and choose an eco dyno. This dyno is a lightweight container to run your project.

15. Open the Resources tab and verify there is no existing Postgres database add-on. If there is one you can destroy it. Hello, World does not use a database and if not destroyed can result in usage costs. If there is a database add-on select Delete Add-on to remove it.

16. Click on Open app to view your deployed project.

Note: You will have to append /hello to the browser URL just as you did locally to see your view output.

### Local Development

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

#### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:
- Git: Version control system to clone the repository.
- Node.js and npm: JavaScript runtime and package manager (or any other language/runtime specific to your project).
- Database: If your project requires a database, ensure the appropriate database server is installed and running (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).

#### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Clone the repository
Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git

Replace https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git with the actual URL of your repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory
Change into the project directory:
bash
cd your-project

3. Install dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
bash
npm install

If your project uses another package manager like Yarn, use:
bash
yarn install

4. Set up environment variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the necessary environment variables. You can use the provided .env.example as a reference:
bash
cp .env.example .env

Edit the .env file to include your specific configuration values.
5. Set up the database
If your project requires a database, set it up by running the migration and seed scripts. For example, if you're using a Node.js project with Sequelize:
bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all

Adjust the commands according to the ORM or database tool your project uses.
Run the development server
6. Start the development server with the following command:
bash
npm start

Or, if your project uses a different command, replace npm start with the appropriate command.
7. Access the application
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in your project) to view the running application.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)
