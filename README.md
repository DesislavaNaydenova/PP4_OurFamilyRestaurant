Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

If you want to add optional [shields.io](https://shields.io) badges to your README, I like to add them to this section.

## User Experience (UX)

The user experience on the finished restaurant website should be intuitive, engaging, and efficient. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what the experience should look like for both visitors (guests) and registered users, as well as the admin:

* General User Experience
  * Intuitive Navigation: The website should be easy to navigate, with a clear and simple menu bar or navigation system that allows users to quickly find what they need (e.g., menu, reservations, location).
  * Responsive Design: The site should be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
  * Visual Appeal: The design should be visually appealing, reflecting the restaurant's brand and atmosphere. High-quality images of the restaurant and its dishes should be prominently featured.
  * Performance: The website should load quickly, with minimal latency, to keep users engaged.
  * Accessibility: The website should be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by following best practices like alt text for images, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.

### User Stories

See our [GitHub User Stories](https://github.com/users/DesislavaNaydenova/projects/4/views/4)

## Design

The design of this project is crafted to ensure a modern, user-friendly, and visually appealing experience, it maintains consistency across all pages and components to provide a unified and professional look. Reusable design elements and patterns are applied to ensure that the interface is predictable and familiar to users.

### Colour Scheme

The color scheme for this project is inspired by the base palette provided by (Start Bootstrap)[https://startbootstrap.com/]

### Typography

For this project, I used the typography base from (Start Bootstrap)[https://startbootstrap.com/]. Start Bootstrap provides a clean and modern design foundation, which includes a well-thought-out typographic system.
The project utilizes the font stack provided by Start Bootstrap, which includes popular web-safe fonts and Google Fonts. This ensures consistent and readable text across different devices and browsers.

### Imagery

Use this section to explain what sort of imagery you plan to use through your site.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using balsamiq.

## Features

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

1. Native Forms and Pages for Admin Actions: In future updates, we plan to integrate native forms and dedicated pages for managing administrative tasks directly within the website. This will include:
- Admin Dashboard: A centralized dashboard where administrators can easily manage reservations, view booking statistics, and handle user inquiries.
- Reservation Management: Forms and pages for reviewing, editing, and canceling reservations.
- User Management: Interfaces for managing user accounts, including the ability to view, edit, and deactivate user accounts as necessary.
- Content Management: Tools for updating and managing menu items, gallery images, and other content on the website without needing direct access to the codebase.

2. Family Gallery: The website includes a gallery showcasing family photos. This section highlights the personal and inviting atmosphere of the restaurant, adding a personal touch to the dining experience.

3. Surrounding Area Photos: To enhance the connection with the local area, the website features a gallery of photos depicting the surrounding environment. This includes scenic views and notable landmarks near the restaurant. 

4. Menu Item Images: Each menu item on the restaurant‚Äôs website is enhanced with high-quality images. These images are displayed alongside the item descriptions to give customers a visual preview of the dishes. This feature improves the user experience by making the menu more engaging and helping customers make more informed choices.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment to Heroku (From Code Institute Lessons)

#### Create the Heroku app 
1. Navigate to your Heroku dashboard and create a new app with a unique name.

2. Click on the Settings tab and reveal the config vars. Add a key of DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and a value of 1 and click Add.

#### Update your code for deployment
3. Install a production-ready webserver for Heroku.
pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1 
Add gunicorn==20.1.0 to the requirements.txt file with:
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
Note: gunicorn is a production equivalent of the manage.py runserver used in development but with speed and security optimisation.

4. Create a file named Procfile at the root directory of the project (same directory as requirements.txt).
Note: The Procfile has no file extension.

5. In the Procfile, declare this is a web process followed by the command to execute your Django project.
web: gunicorn my_project.wsgi
This assumes your project is named my_project.
Note the space after the colon.
Note: gunicorn my_project.wsgi is the command heroku will use to start the server. It works similarly to python3 manage.py runserver.

6. Open the my_project/settings.py file and replace DEBUG=True with DEBUG=False.
Note the comment regarding security in production.

7. Also, in settings.py we need to append the Heroku hostname to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list
,'.herokuapp.com'
Note: Remember the comma and the dot before herokuapp.

8. You can now git add the files you have modified, git commit them and push them to GitHub.

#### Deploy on Heroku
9. Now, let's return to the Heroku dashboard, and in your app, click on the Deploy tab.

10. In the Deployment method section enable GitHub integration by clicking on Connect to GitHub.
If you have not deployed a project from GitHub before then, you will be asked to authenticate with GitHub.

11. Start typing your project repo name into the search box and click Search. A list of repositories from your GitHub account should appear. Click on the GitHub repo you want to deploy from.

12. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Deploy Branch to start a manual deployment of the main branch.
You can view the build output in the application's Activity tab in the dashboard.

13. Click on Open app to view your deployed project.
Note: You will have to append /hello to the browser URL just as you did locally to see your view output.

14. Open the Resources tab and choose an eco dyno. This dyno is a lightweight container to run your project.

15. Open the Resources tab and verify there is no existing Postgres database add-on. If there is one you can destroy it. Hello, World does not use a database and if not destroyed can result in usage costs. If there is a database add-on select Delete Add-on to remove it.

16. Click on Open app to view your deployed project.
Note: You will have to append /hello to the browser URL just as you did locally to see your view output.

### Local Development

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

#### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:
- Git: Version control system to clone the repository.
- Node.js and npm: JavaScript runtime and package manager (or any other language/runtime specific to your project).

Edit the .env file to include your specific configuration values.

5. Set up the database
If your project requires a database, set it up by running the migration and seed scripts. For example, if you're using a Node.js project with Sequelize:
bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
Adjust the commands according to the ORM or database tool your project uses.
Run the development server

6. Start the development server with the following command:
bash
npm start
Or, if your project uses a different command, replace npm start with the appropriate command.

## Bugs

### Fixed Bugs

1. When adding a menu item the input is displayed as HTML.

![Input as HTML](assets/images/summernote_bug.png)

- The solution was to use the bleach library to sanitize the input.

![Input fix](assets/images/summernote_bug_solution.png)

2. In the Opening Hours the days of the week weren't in the right order.

![Opening Hours Bug](assets/images/opening_hours_bug.png)

- The solution was to annotate the queryset with the custom order and then order by this annotation.

![Opening Hours fix](assets/images/opening_hours_bug_solution.png)

3. The Date format was not valid

![Valide Date format](assets/images/valide_date_bug.png)

- Changed the format in the user_reservation view in order to fulfill the Django expectations.

4. After deploying it Heroku the siccess modal doesn't show the date and time of the reservation

![Success Modal Date an Time](assets/images/success_modal_bug.png)

- Store the reservation date and time in the session so that they can be displayed in the success modal.

![Success Modal Date an Time Fix](assets/images/success_modal_fix.png)

5. When trying to edit the reservations time, the user gets an error message, that the table has already been reserved for the day.

![Editing Reservatin Time](assets/images/edit_reservation_bug.png)

- Modify the clean_table method in the UserReservationForm to check if the current reservation instance is the same as the one being edited.

![Editing Reservatin Time Fix](assets/images/edit_reservation_fix.png)

6. It was possible to reserve a specific table for every hour during the open hours, but we don't want that.

![Double reservation on one day](assets/images/table_reservation_bug.png)

- Change the clean_table method in the UserReservationForm, so that a table can not be reserved more than once a day.

![Double reservation on one day not possible](assets/images/table_reservation_fix.png)

7. Getting an attribute error when trying to make a guest reservation.

![Attribute Error](assets/images/for-attribute-error.png)

- Added autocomplete and id to the guest reservation form.

![Attribute Error Fix](assets/images/for-attribute-error-fix.png)

### Unfixed Bugs

1. Due to the Summernote styling an error is being shown when validating the URL of the menu_list

![URL validation error](assets/images/url_validation_summernote_bug.png)

- Removed the h4 elememt, in order to prevent the first error, but the styling from summernote doesn't change. 

2. The user gets an error message after trying to submit the reservation.

![Date Error Message](assets/images/closed_date_alert.png)

- Due to lack of time we weren't able to change the code.
